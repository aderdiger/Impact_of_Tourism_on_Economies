# Project-3
## Project Overview
This is a data visualization project that focuses on the impact of tourism on top travel destinations in the world in terms of their gross domestic product (GDP). The study will focus on analyzing the historical trends of these top ten tourism destinations as of 2023.

We collected data from the UNWTO and World Bank websites, cleaned the data in Python and stored it in a SQL database. Using Pandas and SQLAlchemy, we extracted and organized the data. Finally, we used JavaScript to design visualizations that include interactive elements such as a dropdown menu with several selected nations.

## How to Use
To interact with the Javascript powered visuals, the user will select a single country of interest from the dropdown menu.

Once a country is selected, a series of visualizations depicting the relationship between tourism and GDP will be displayed.
